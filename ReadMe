Good Advice I Got From LeetCode:
A common question when first joining LeetCode is: "Where should I start?"
No two software engineers take the exact same journey. 
We all learn different skills at different times and, therefore should distribute our time and attention differently in order to maximize our studies.

------------

Time Complexity: Measures how the time to run an algorithm
Space Complexity: Measures how the memory usage of an algorithm

For any for loop:
When calculating the per iteration time complexity, we consider the operations inside the loop body.

For any while loop:
When calculating the per iteration time complexity, we consider all operations that occur within each while loop iteration, including the condition evaluation.
The condition evaluation happens every time before the loop body executes, so it contributes to the per iteration time.

- defining a function
- initializing a variable
- adding two value
